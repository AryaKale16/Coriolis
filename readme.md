## Introduction
This code demonstrates an implementation of the BM25+RD (BM25 with relevance feedback) algorithm for information retrieval. The algorithm calculates scores for documents in a corpus based on the relevance of a user query. The code uses a preprocessed corpus of text documents, and the relevance feedback is based on the user's feedback to the retrieved results.

## Getting Started
To run this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following libraries:

PyPDF2
NLTK
You can install these libraries by running the following commands:

!pip install PyPDF2
!pip install nltk


## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter notebook in your local machine.
Upload your text documents to the input directory.
Run the code cells in the notebook.
Input a query in the designated cell, and run the cell to retrieve the relevant documents.
## Code Overview
Collect the corpus of text documents.
Preprocess the documents by tokenizing, removing stop words and punctuation, and stemming.
Calculate the term frequency (TF) for each document.
Calculate the inverse document frequency (IDF) for each term in the corpus.
Calculate the document length for each document.
Build an index of terms and their corresponding documents, with TF and IDF values.
Perform a query using the BM25+RD algorithm to retrieve relevant documents
